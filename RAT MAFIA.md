WHY DO YOU EXIST
originates in [[Voltulin]] from current knowledge.

Found out after accidently exploding a rat named [[JEREMY THE RAT]] 

we gifted [[JEREMY THE RAT]]s owner 2 new rats as an apology both belonged to the [[RAT MAFIA]] 
One of the 2 gets killed by the other and a building blown up by the rat mafia.
