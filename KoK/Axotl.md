#Magod

- proonunced (aux-ol)
 (it is fucking 4 am)
 
 - She does not manage the rebirth or death, just the souls, think of hades in greek mythology, god of the dead realm, not death itself, more paperwork less murder.

- Her appearance in the physical realm is a crow with red eyes, some are not death in the physical realm so its hard to tell if you're talking to her or a random ass crow.

- She doesnt try to hide herself from mortals, quite the opposite and thats why people fear crows and named a group of crows a murder.
  
- She has mad contracts with multiple groups each time the demon king ressurected. Not all old group members are dead.

- She tries to tell groups where to go but if they disobey her she tends to cause some event to force them back onto the "correct" path that she needs them on.
