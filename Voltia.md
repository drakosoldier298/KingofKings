#Magod

- goddess of life
- tends to hide herself more than her sister
- doesnt tend to talk to mortals because mortals have deceived her, and that is why it is rare to hear of a "champion of life", it is said the only ones that exist are "pure of soul", think of king arthur.
- If she does choose a champion they tend to almost purge the world of all evil for amonth~ before it goes back to normal the embodiment of "there is no life without death, no good without evil"
- talks to one person, [[Aasumi]]
