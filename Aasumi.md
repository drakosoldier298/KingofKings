- has been known to show mercy to things inhuman or not accepted by other goddess'.
- The youngest out of all Major gods
- one of the people who have tried to fight Celest in the past for reasons, the first fight was the war between her followers and celests folowers because she did not accept celest as a major god, ended with aasumi having no followers due to them dying in war, a god without followers is weak in the eyes of many, so Celest gained more power making aasumi fall to the lowest of the major gods.
